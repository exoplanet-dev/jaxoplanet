    "# Units\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the user-facing interfaces in `jaxoplanet` support units using the [`jpu` package](https://github.com/dfm/jpu).\n",
    "As far as we know, `jaxoplanet` is the only user of this unit system, and this API should be considered somewhat experimental, but we think that there are benefits to being unambiguous about units where possible.\n",
    "So, here we provide an overview of how `jpu` works and how it interacts with `jaxoplanet`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For technical reasons, the `jpu` package is built on top of [`Pint`](https://pint.readthedocs.io), rather than [`astropy.units`](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/), so the interface might be unfamiliar to some users, but we hope that we can provide enough information here to get you started.\n",
    "Please also refer to the [`jpu`](https://github.com/dfm/jpu) and [`Pint`](https://pint.readthedocs.io) documentation for more details.\n",

    "To start, we import the \"unit registry\" from `jaxoplanet`, which will provide the building blocks for interacting with our unit system:"
